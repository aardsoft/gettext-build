This repository contains gettext builds for Windows - see the github workflow for details.

Some distributions (including Ubuntu, as used on the github runners) don't package gettext/libintl for their mingw builds. It also is not possible to build it with a compiler like Visual C. A repository containing build output that can be used as submodule is therefore an easy workaround for this.
